TSL (Test and Set Lock)

TSL is an atomic assembly instruction that
copies a variable's value and then set it to '1'


TSL syntax is "TSL RX, LOCK"

'RX' is a register that stores LOCK's old
value, and 'LOCK' is the variable being set
to '1'

Since TSL is an atomic instruction, a machine
with that instruction has to make sure no process
executing it will be interrupted before LOCK's
old value is copied to 'RX' and 'LOCK' is set
to '1'

Check how exactly TSL works. Click "Execute" to
execute "TSL REGISTER, LOCK" once. If you wish,
you can edit each value by clicking on then and
typing a new one.
